<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I often found myself forgetting the Korean TV shows I had watched or wanted to watch in the future. I didn’t want to use trackers like MyDramaList as they were bloated with features and made it hard to precisely only track Korean TV shows. Additionally, there is no tracker specifically made for tracking Korean TV shows. To fix this problem, HangukDramaList is a tracker to track Korean TV shows watched, currently watching, plan to watch and on hold.
